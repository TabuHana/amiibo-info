# Amiibo-Info

<a name="Description"></a>

## Description

This application is a personal project I designed to help a store owner manage their store. This content management system is created using React and Node.js with TailwindCSS for styling. I also utilized chartjs in react-chartjs-2 to get the responsive graphs. This project has been a test of will and knowledge for me. Getting it to where it is now was no easy task but ultimately I have come out a much better programmer.

This application is a re-design of a project I helped build. Amiibo Locator is made to help people find information about amiibos based on character name. This app uses ReactJS for responsiveness and tailwindcss combined with DaisyUI to build its layout.

<a name="Project Setup"></a>

## Project Setup

All you will need node.js to run this application and download its dependencies. If you do not have node.js installed you can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/). You will also need `git` installed which you can download [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Run `npm i` in your git terminal to install the needed dependencies. You will also need to create a `.env` file for this project. Naming conventions are `REACT_APP_AMIIBO_URL="https://amiiboapi.com/api/amiibo"`.
This is a public API so an env file is not necessary, but for practice it was implemented.

## Usage
